Project Title: Traffic Relations

Team: Eric Ha, David Nyberg, Nicholas Sugarman

Description of project: We seek to use data mining processes and techniques to extract useful knowledge and information regarding traffic volume per season relative to the type of road (Urban vs. Rural). Furthermore, we want to visualize the data and display our findings. We are using a dataset provided by: https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/us-traffic-2015 

Summary of questions: We wanted to know whether factors such as the season of the year, time of day, and type of road influenced the volume of traffic. We discovered that certain times of day are consistently busier than others and that the season of the year does have an influence on traffic volume. We also discovered that this data differs between rural and urban roads, meaning that the type of road one drives on can influence the average traffic volume of that road.

Application of Knowledge: People can use our findings to help plan when they will and won't drive due to the high or low volume of traffic at certain times. This data can also be used in construction to help determine which seasons would be best for doing the bulk of projects which may potentially shut down road lanes.
